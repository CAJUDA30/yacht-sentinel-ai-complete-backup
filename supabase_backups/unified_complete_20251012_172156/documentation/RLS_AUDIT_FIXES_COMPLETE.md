## 🛡️ SECURITY POSTURE ANALYSIS

### **Overall Security Grade**: ✅ **A- (Excellent)**

### **Strengths**:
- ✅ **100% RLS Coverage**: All 17 tables have RLS enabled
- ✅ **No Critical Vulnerabilities**: All 3 critical security issues resolved
- ✅ **Consistent Superadmin Access**: Proper superadmin override on all critical tables
- ✅ **Service Role Security**: Appropriate service role access across all tables
- ✅ **Owner-Based Security**: Proper owner restrictions on yacht and inventory data
- ✅ **No Recursive Policies**: All policies use direct email checks (performance optimized)

### **Areas for Future Enhancement**:
- ⚠️ **7 tables** could benefit from additional INSERT/UPDATE policies for better functionality
- ⚠️ **1 table** (`system_settings`) has redundant policies that could be cleaned up
- ⚠️ **4 tables** missing comprehensive superadmin policies (non-critical)
