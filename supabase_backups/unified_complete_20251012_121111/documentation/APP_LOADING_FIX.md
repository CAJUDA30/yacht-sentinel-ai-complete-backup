# App Loading Issue - Fixed

## ❌ Problem
The app was not loading properly after the authentication and navigation fixes.

## 🔍 Root Cause
**Duplicate import statement in `src/App.tsx`**

The file had:
```typescript
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster";  // Line 1
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster";  // Line 2 - DUPLICATE!
import { Toaster as Sonner } from "@/components/ui/sonner";
```

This caused a TypeScript compilation error:
```
Duplicate identifier 'Toaster'. ts(2300)
```

The duplicate was accidentally created during the previous fix when I tried to re-add the missing Toaster import.

## ✅ Fix Applied

Removed the duplicate import. The file now correctly has:
```typescript
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster";
import { Toaster as Sonner } from "@/components/ui/sonner";
import { TooltipProvider } from "@/components/ui/tooltip";
// ... rest of imports
```

## 🚀 Status

✅ **TypeScript compilation errors**: Fixed  
✅ **Vite dev server**: Running on port 5173  
✅ **App should now load**: Ready to test

## 📝 To Verify

1. Open browser to: `http://localhost:5173`
2. App should load without errors
3. All previous fixes still in place:
   - ✅ SuperAdminProvider in component tree
   - ✅ Auto-redirect after login
   - ✅ Tab switching handled
   - ✅ RLS policies fixed
   - ✅ Non-blocking health checks

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

The app should now:
- Load immediately (< 1 second)
- Show login page if not authenticated
- Redirect to home after login
- Handle tab switching smoothly
- No console errors (except expected AI provider warnings)

**Fixed:** Duplicate import causing compilation failure  
**Status:** 🟢 Ready to use
